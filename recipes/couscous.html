    <p><i>Couscous is a North African dish made from tiny steamed balls of semolina flour. Though we think of it and cook it as a grain, it’s actually a type of pasta. Traditionally, couscous is steamed in a special double-chambered cooking vessel called a couscousière, which is a time-consuming process. However, here in the States, we often use the instant variety of couscous that cooks up in just 5 minutes—making it one of the quickest and most versatile side dishes around, way faster than basmati rice or mashed potatoes.</i></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1¾ cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth (or water)        </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil        </li>
        <li>1½ cups (10 oz) instant couscous        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, bring the water (or broth), salt, butter, and oil to a boil. Stir in the couscous, cover tightly with a lid, and remove from heat. Let the couscous steam for 5 minutes. Use a fork to fluff the couscous and break up any clumps. Serve warm.</p>
