    <p><i>Chicken tagine is a traditional Moroccan dish of chicken pieces braised with spices, garlic, onion, olives, and preserved lemons. It’s company-worthy yet easy to throw together.</i></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Season both sides of chicken pieces with 2 teaspoons salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or pan over medium-high heat until beginning to smoke. Brown the chicken pieces skin side down in single layer until deep golden, about 5 minutes; using tongs, flip the chicken pieces over and brown the other side, about 4 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a large plate; when cool enough to handle, peel off the skin and discard. Pour off and discard all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan.</p>
